Hi! My name is Hernán Alperin.

5
00:00:06,856 --> 00:00:08,122
a very difficult guy to get by,

6
00:00:08,622 --> 00:00:09,688
and I'm here because

7
00:00:10,388 --> 00:00:12,754
I developed the Core of the segmenter at the INDEC.

8
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:15,759
You may ask what the INDEC is.

9
00:00:15,459 --> 00:00:16,759
Well, It's in Argentina, a country lost in the end south
of the World in the Western hemisfer.

10
00:00:16,259 --> 00:00:16,959
The INDEC is the National Bureau of Census,

11
00:00:17,059 --> 00:00:17,759
and one of its main tasks is to
count how many Argentinians we are.

12
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:25,070
