Hi! My name is Hernán Alperin.

00:00:06,856 --> 00:00:10,856
a very difficult guy to get by, and I'm here because
I developed the Core of the segmenter at the INDEC.

00:00:13,159 --> 00:00:14,759
You may ask what the INDEC is.

7
00:00:14,859 --> 00:00:16,159
The INDEC is the National Bureau of Census, and one of its main tasks is to count how many Argentinians we are.

8
00:00:16,259 --> 00:00:17,759
Well, It's in Argentina, a country lost in the end south of the World in the Western hemisfer.
