Hi! My name is Hernán Alperin.

00:00:06,856 --> 00:00:08,356
a very difficult guy to get by, and I'm here because
I developed the Core of the segmenter at the INDEC.

00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:09,259
You may ask what the INDEC is.

7
00:00:09,359 --> 00:00:10,859
ell, It's in Argentina, a country lost in the end south of the World in the Western hemisfer.

8
00:00:10,959 --> 00:00:12,459
The INDEC is the National Bureau of Census, and one of its main tasks is to count how many Argentinians we are.
